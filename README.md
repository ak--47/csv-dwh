## üåç Overview

`ak-fetch` is a powerful and flexible tool designed for making bulk `POST` requests to an API endpoint. It provides a simple interface to batch and queue requests which send data over the network; it adds oft needed features like concurrency control, retries, fire-and-forget making it a robust solution for handling large data transfer operations with ease.

i built this module when creating **[hello-mixpanel](https://github.com/ak--47/hello-mixpanel)** as i needed a way to send large amounts of data to various SaaS analytics APIs in a reliable and efficient manner. it was useful enough for me, that i made it into a proper package.

## üöÄ Installation

To get started with `ak-fetch`, install the module using npm:

```bash
npm install ak-fetch
```

you may also use `npx` to run the CLI without installing the package:

```bash
npx ak-fetch --help
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage
Use ak-fetch as a module directly in your node script:

```javascript
const akFetch = require('ak-fetch');
const config = {
        url: 'https://api.example.com',
        data: [...],
		batchSize: 10,
		concurrency: 5,
		delay: 1000,
        // ... other configurations
};

try {
	const responses = await akFetch(config);
	console.log('API Responses:', responses);
} catch (error) {
	console.error('Error:', error);
}
```
or via the command line: 
```bash
npx ak-fetch --url https://api.example.com './payloads.json' --batchSize 10 --concurrency 5
```
Use `--help` to see all options
